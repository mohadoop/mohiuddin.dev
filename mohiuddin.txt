Hi, I'm mohiuddin.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag -->



About Me!!! 

Iâ€™m Mohiuddin, a Cloud Big Data Architect with over 15 years of experience transforming data into scalable solutions for Fortune 100 companies. My work sits at the intersection of data engineering, cloud computing, and analytics, where I design systems that turn complexity into clarity.  

My journey began at 16 when I bought my first computerâ€”sparking a lifelong passion for technology. That curiosity led me to study Public Health Information Systems at Swedenâ€™s Karolinska Institute (with a focus on quantitative analysis) and later earn a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science, specializing in Cloud Computing Architecture, from the University of Maryland.  

When Iâ€™m not architecting data platforms, Iâ€™m exploring new tech, mentoring, or collaborating on innovative projects. Letâ€™s build something meaningful together.
